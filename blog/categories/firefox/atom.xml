    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had been using Chrome for a while. However, I found Chrome occupies too many memory. So, I decided to switch back to FireFox which I had used it for 6 years.</p>

<p>When I learned how to use FireFox again, I discovered a extension called <a href="http://www.vimperator.org/about">&ldquo;Vimperator&rdquo;</a>. It can make FireFox Vim-like browser. At this moment, I am not familiar with Vim. But I decided to give Vimperator a shot. It did lead me to another world. Now I can not live without Vimperator when I browse the internet. At the beginning, it was difficult to use Vimperator. But the more I practice, the more efficiency I am. Now I am interested to learn more about Vim and its design philosophy. I am glad that I tried Vimperator. I find Vim&rsquo;s concept is everywhere. It is a skill set for long-term use.</p>
